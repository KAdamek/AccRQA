How to contribute
*****************
You can contribute through GitHub issues and branches. 
The aim should be small targeted contributions resulting in small and correct pull requests.
Long-lived branches tend to get old quickly and are usually too large to go
through in one code review session therefore significantly reduces chances of sucessfull pull request.
