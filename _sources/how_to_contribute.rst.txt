How to contribute
*****************
People can contribute in different ways. One of them is to let us know how you use the AccRQA package and what features you are missing. You can do this through GitHub issues.
You can contribute by reporting bugs through GitHub issues and committing code via branches. 
The aim should be small targeted contributions resulting in small and correct pull requests.
Long-lived branches tend to get old quickly and are usually too large to go through in one code review session, significantly reducing the chances of successful pull requests.
