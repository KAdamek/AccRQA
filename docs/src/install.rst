Installation guide

The C library
=============

The AccRQA library can be compiled from source using CMake. To install and use AccRQA you need following:
  * *Operating system*: Linux or Windows 10+
  * *Build tools*: ``CMake`` 3.13 or newer 
  * *Compiler*: ``GCC``  8.1 or newer for linux or ``MSVC`` 2019 or newer for Windows 10
  * **(Optional)** *CUDA Toolkit* (e.g., 11.x or newer) — required for GPU acceleration. 

To install git you can go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and follow instruction from there. If GPU acceleration is required, make sure the CUDA toolkit is installed first.

Linux
-----

Clone AccRQA repository using:

  .. code-block:: bash

     git clone https://github.com/KAdamek/AccRQA.git

From the top-level directory of the AccRQA, run the following commands to compile and
install the library:

  .. code-block:: bash

     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake [OPTIONS] ../
     make
     make install

Suitable CUDA architecture is selected by nvcc when compiling because the default option for CUDA is ``-DCUDA_ARCH="native"``. However, if you need to specify the CUDA architecture, use ``-DCUDA_ARCH="x.y"`` flag, where x and y are major and minor compute capability on NVIDIA GPU. 
For example, for architecture `7.0`, use

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     cmake -DCUDA_ARCH="7.0" ../

To compile binding to R, you have to specify R library location using 
``-DCMAKE_R_LIB_DIR`` and location of the R include directory using 
``-DCMAKE_R_INC_DIR``. For example

  .. code-block:: bash

     cmake -DCMAKE_R_INC_DIR="/usr/share/R/include" -DCMAKE_R_LIB_DIR="/usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so"  ../

To compile tests use ``-DBUILD_TESTS=ON`` which compiles test executable performing a series of tests of supported RQA metrics.

An example application that uses the AccRQA library can be compiled with a flag ``-DBUILD_APPLICATIONS=ON``.

Windows
-------

To compile the AccRQA library from source on Windows 10 you will require:
  * *Build tools*: ``CMake`` 3.13 or newer 
  * *Compiler*: ``MSVC`` 2019 or newer


In command line you can build AccRQA by

  .. code-block:: bash

     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake .. [OPTIONS]
     cmake --build .
     cmake --install .

Python package
==============

Install from source package
---------------------------

We encourage you to install the accrqa package from the source package, as Python binary wheels do not support GPUs well and accrqa package will be compiled directly for GPU architecture you have. For the installation you will require an compiler installed (GCC for linux or MSVC for Windows), CUDA toolkit if GPU acceleration is desired and setuptools 63.1.0 or newer. To install accrqa from source use:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install accrqa

Install from the binary wheel
-----------------------------

To install accrqa from binary wheel use:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip3 install accrqa*.whl

Install from the local repository
---------------------------------

To install accrqa from local repository, clone AccRQA repository using:

  .. code-block:: bash

     git clone https://github.com/KAdamek/AccRQA.git

From the top-level directory, run the following commands to install
the Python package:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip3 install .

The compiled library will be built as part of this step, so it does not need to
be installed separately. If extra CMake arguments need to be specified, set the
environment variable ``CMAKE_ARGS`` first, for example:

  .. code-block:: bash

     CMAKE_ARGS="-DCUDA_ARCH=7.0" pip3 install .


Uninstalling
------------

The Python package can be uninstalled using:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip3 uninstall accrqa

Installing on Windows
---------------------

To install accrqa package on Windows the easiest way is to use the binary wheels. To install accrqa using binary wheels use:

  .. code-block:: bash

     py -m pip install accrqa*.whl


To install accrqa Python package on Windows from source you need to have 

Windows requirements:
  - MSVC compiler (part of Visual Studio)
  - CMake for Windows

To install from PiPy using pip:

  .. code-block:: bash

     py -m pip install accrqa

To install from the local repository in command line:

  .. code-block:: bash

     py -m pip install .

R package
=========

System Requirements
-------------------

To install and use the AccRQA R package, the following system requirements apply:
  * *R version*: 4.0 or newer.
  * *Operating system*: Linux.
  * *Build tools*: ``gcc``, ``g++``, ``make`` (usually provided by ``build-essentials``).
  * **(Optional)** *CUDA Toolkit* (e.g., 11.x or newer) — required for GPU acceleration. 

    *  Ensure ``nvcc`` and ``cuda_runtime.h`` are available in the environment.
    *  Set ``CUDA_HOME`` if the toolkit is not in the default path.

You can install the AccRQA R package either from a downloaded source archive (e.g., ``.tar.gz`` or ``.zip``) or directly within RStudio.

Option 1: Install from .zip or .tar.gz in RStudio
-------------------------------------------------

  #.  Open RStudio.
  #.  Go to Tools → Install Packages.
  #.  From the box Install from select "Package Archive File (.tar.gz / .zip)" as the sources.
  #.  Click Browse, and select the downloaded file (e.g., AccRQA_x.y.z.tar.gz where the x.y.z refers to the specific version number).
  #.  Click Install.

Option 2: Install from the Command Line
---------------------------------------

The downloaded archive can be install by using the R console:

.. code-block:: bash

  install.packages("AccRQA_x.y.z.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

or from your system's terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  R CMD INSTALL AccRQA_x.y.z.tar.gz
