How to contribute
*****************

The aim and aspiration is to get closer to the trunk mode of development with
the AccRQA repository.
That is, work in small steps and merge correct code with the main branch often.
Frequent merges prevent large, complicated and hard-to-review merge
requests, and keep the number of branches to a minimum.
Long-lived branches tend to get old quickly. They are usually too large to go
through in one code review session and create a jungle of different code
versions containing different features.
This puts unnecessary strain on maintainers. 
Furthermore, long-lived branches might be used to develop dependent code,
which requires more effort to merge in the future.
