## Repository contributions

If you are happy to contribute to the code, you can do so via git branches and pull requests. Contributions can be made in Python or R interfaces and functions as well as in C/C++ library. The C/C++ library contains CPU functions parallelised using OpenMP and CUDA GPU kernels. Further work could be done to optimise the calculation of RQA for specific use cases and improve existing performance.
